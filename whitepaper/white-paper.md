# 📰 White Paper

### Abstract:

UXLINK is a block-chain based social system for mass adopters to build social assets and trade cryptos, with the vision to be a trusted infrastructure product for mass adoption of inclusive finance and trading. There are three goals of UXLINK:

* To be the largest social system based on users’ real-world connections and behaviors.
* To cater to both Web3 and Web2 users, facilitating mass adoption, serving 100 million users.
* To establish fair and rewarding social-nomics and community.

SOCIAL would the most powerful key to Web3 mass adoption, and UXLINK is the innovator in social and socialized trading. UXLINK contains a series of highly modularized Dapps from onboarding to graph forming, to group tools, to socialized trading, close-looped in Telegram. Among all, encrypting and standardizing real-world groups into web3 operational units and making groups the landing scenes for web3 applications is a revolutionary innovation.

UXLINK adopt a dual-token economics to strike a balance among simplicity, fairness, and effectiveness.

### 1.Real life problems we are facing: ownership, trust and inclusive finance

#### 1.1 Lack of clarity in social data ownership, although social data and networks are valuable and irreplaceable assets for all mankind.

Ownership is the foundation of value sharing. Web2 users generate a significant amount of data, but they own and benefit little from centralized web world. The data ownership issue also prevents developers from bootstrapping innovative products and features. Developers need users’ connections to initiate network effects, but the lack of accessible and composable data which should be owned by the users.

#### 1.2 Trust is still one of biggest concerns for web3 users.

Despite blockchain technology being designed to address trust issues in the web world, rug pulls continue to occur very often. This is partially caused by the anonymous mechanism. And we believe social graph and socialized interaction can improve trust, creating greater sense of safety.

#### 1.3 Huge groups of people are still financially underserved or benefited unevenly.

According to the 2021 World Bank Global Findex, more than 20% of adults (age 15+) are unbanked, not to mention other financial services. And huge amounts of business units do not have fair profit-sharing schemes for contributors. Block-chain technology, born to solve finance problems, may help people build financial health and resilience along the way with mass adoption and scheme designed by UXLINK.

## 2.UXLINK system is the solutions to the issues

To overcome the stated issues, we are creating a series of protocol and Dapps for users and developers, where users can truly own their social assets and trade, invest their assets socially in a more trusted and socialized environment.

### 2.1 Design philosophy and principles

While UXLINK is evolving, we formed below 3 core principles and philosophy as the guidelines:

**User sovereignty first.** User sovereignty includes users having ownership and control over online identities, social connections, social data, with data privacy protection.&#x20;

**Synergize with real-world connections.** We do believe real world connections represent and reflect an individual's reputation, credibility, and values. This fills a key gap that has been missing so far in the blockchains and token-powered protocols.

**Inclusion for users and developers.** For users, we create and choose friendly products and technology for both web2 and web3 environments; for developers, we provide completely open-sourced, easy programmed infrastructure that Dapps can be easily integrated wit. Inclusion leads to scalability.



### 2.2 Major features and functions - UX Dapps

#### 2.2.1 For users:

**UX Invite**: UX Invite is light Dapp with link to earn mechanism for users to build their on chain social graph.

**UX Wallet**: based on MPC and will be enhanced by Account Abstraction technology. Major advantages include private key social recovery, fund custody, and automatic executions to better strike the balance between safety and simplicity.

**UX DID/Profile**: Users can create Web3 accounts through Telegram, WhatsApp, etc,, reducing the threshold for users to enter Web3. Web3 DIDs reflect and capture users’ existing real-world connections, and thus reflect the real-world credibility. Profile. By ZK (Zero-knowledge proof) technology, users own and utilize their self-sovereign identities (SSI) and social relationships with privacy protection.

#### 2.2.2 For groups:

Encrypting social group is innovative and revolutionary. Groups are the most adopted operational units in real world, and UXLINK encrypt and standardize the groups into web3 operational units and making groups the landing scenes for web3 applications.

Groupkits include group capitalization and profit/asset-sharing scheme. GroupKits will impower real group groups and group leaders.

### 2.3 UXLINK protocol

UXLINK protocol is more for developers. The protocol is on Arbitrum chain for now, providing UXLINK with secure and low-cost technical services. In the future, UXLINK will continue to launch on other chains, supporting multi-chain. API and SDKs are provided to developers and partners.

### 2.4 Other Rich Dapps under developing.&#x20;

**AI GroupKit Bot:** A decentralized AI Dapp for individuals and projects to build and manage their community. The bot is suitable for Telegram system.

**PartyBot:** A social trading Dapp for users to conduct socialized trading and investments, including follow buy, group buy, just like a game.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">3.Usage scenarios</mark>

Let us go through one user's journey, his name is Alex:

3.1 Alex uses UXLINK protocol to create his networks in web3, wallets, DIDs, profiles, forming his social assets. Alex can manage and engage his social networks in both Web3 and Web2 settings.

3.2. Alex monetizes his social networks by providing traffic, data and engagement, such as social games, social marketing, fission for Dapps; on the other hand, Dapps leverage Alex' networks to gain new audiences or engagement while rewarding Alex.

3.3 Alex can engage socialized finance and trading, such as swap, light investment, borrowing, payments, credit, and insurance, in a safer and friendly environment, to achieve better returns.

3.4 More importantly, Alex can play a leader role in group activities to influence other users and get more incentives.

## 4. Revenue Model

In principle, users, rather than UXLINK, owners the networks and the data associated. Consequently, users own the values generated, while UXLINK share.

The revenue source for UXLINK are three folds:

* Gas fee: There are data owners, and data demanders. If there is data movement, UXLINK change certain % of fee as "gas". If Dapps generate revenue in the network, UXLINK also changes certain % of fees.
* Service fee: if partners (Dapp creators) need help from community to attract new audiences, service fee may be charged.
* Product sell: community or project may advance tools or unique identifications such as NFTs
* Commission fee: UXLINK will charge certain % of commission fee on socialized trading Dapps.

The tokens received include $UXUY and other cryptos.

The revenue will be used for community development and tokens price management.

## 5. Token Economics

UXLINK Protocol apply a dual-token model, consisting of the protocol’s native utility tokens (UXUY, as POW records) and governance tokens ($UXLINK).

The dual-token model provides a framework of governance and development of our community and ecosystem, while maximizing the transparency and fairness.

### 5.1 UXLINK Utility Tokens (UXUY)

UXUY is the reward system for UXLINK community and ecosystem development, simply and purely based on a fair Proof of Link (POL) mechanism. There is no pre-minted UXUY. Anyone who wants to earn UXUY needs to invite other users or contribute to the ecosystem. UXUY Tokens can be stored in an Ethereum-compatible wallet. The earlier the user creates their social network, the more UXUY they will receive.​

#### 5.1.1 UXUY Token Reward Decreasing Formula

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```vue
 Rewards = OG * [ TAM(ts) * (1 + EAR（cLg）)* cLu / log2(cLg) ]
```
{% endcode %}

#### Where:

* TAM(ts0) = <mark style="color:green;">max(3000 - \[(ts0 - tsG)/3600\*24], 1)</mark>
* EAR(cLg) = <mark style="color:green;">max((k/100) - 0.001 \* \[cLg / 100000], 0)</mark>
* OG - Users holding <mark style="background-color:green;">SEAMAN NFTs</mark> are OG users, and their incentive weighting coefficient is <mark style="color:green;">120%</mark>.
* TAM - Time amplifier, incentivizes early adopters.
* EAR - Early Adopter Reward, incentivizes early contributors.
  * For networks with <mark style="color:green;">0-100,000</mark> people, the EAR incentive factor starts at 90%.
  * For networks with <mark style="color:green;">100,000-1,000,000</mark> people, the EAR incentive factor starts at 30%.
  * After <mark style="color:green;">1,000,000</mark> people, the EAR incentive factor decreases to <mark style="color:green;">10%</mark> and decreases linearly by <mark style="color:green;">0.1%</mark> every <mark style="color:green;">100,000</mark> people.
  * k - EAR incentive factor:
    * _<mark style="color:green;">`[cLg < 100,000, k=40].`</mark>_
    * _<mark style="color:green;">`[10 < cLg <`</mark>_ <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">1,000,000</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">`, k=20].`</mark>_
    * _<mark style="color:green;">`[cLg >`</mark>_ <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">1,000,000</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">`, k=10].`</mark>_\

* ts0 - the current node's establishment time.
* tsG - the project's genesis release start time.
* cLu - the number of people who established the current node.
* cLg - the total number of people in the UXLINK network.
* When <mark style="color:green;">cLg >= 30 million</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">Rewards = 0</mark>, which means that no new UXUY Tokens will be produced once the network reaches <mark style="color:green;">30 million</mark>. At that time, the value formed by the network effect can support users and nodes to continue expanding and reach a level of billions.

The UXUY  uses a decrement logic similar to Bitcoin's and uses a computational formula closest to Bitcoin's mining logic. The variables that decrease the Token include time, the number of people connected to a single node, and the total number of people in the UXLINK network. Therefore, as time passes after the release of UXUY and the number of people in the entire UXLINK network increases, the UXUY Tokens earned by users will decrease exponentially, and the later users enter the UXLINK network, the fewer UXUY Tokens they will receive.

#### 5.1.2 UXUY Token Burn Mechanism

UXUY is the UXLINK Protocol's application token and can be used to pay for Gas fees on-chain in the UXLINK ecosystem, including on-chain transactions, transfers, and social network reading. In the UXLINK ecosystem, 【3-15%】 of these fees will be burned.

### 5.2 UXLINK Governance tokens

Our to-be-issued governance token - $UXLINK is to realize governance and value capture from UXLINK project and products.

#### 5.2.1 Total Supply and Allocation

The tokens have limited supply of no more than 1,000,000,000 and we propose below allocation based on maximized supply.



<table><thead><tr><th width="144"></th><th width="493.3333333333333">Composition</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Community</strong></td><td>Users who own UXLINK utility tokens, and builders and partners contributed to UXLINK projects and ecosystems.</td><td>   70</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Private Sale</strong></td><td>Investors invested cash into this project.</td><td> 16.25</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td>Co-founders, contracted employees, advisors</td><td>   8.75</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Treasure</strong></td><td>Reserves for price and liquidity management such as lunch pads, reserves, staking.</td><td>     5</td></tr></tbody></table>

Notes：

* Among the 70% of community, users account \~40% while all other types of builders and partners account \~30%.
* For development of the project, new investors would be in, and this would change the distributions. we will keep the change transparent if it occurs.

#### 5.2.2 release schedule

Please note the starting point is upon listing, not TGE

* Community: the $UXLINK will be airdropped to active users, builders and partners based on the proof of work/UXLINK tokens monthly-basis. Once airdropped, there is no lock up and release schedule required.
* Investors: Lock up 3 months, and then 2-years linear quarterly release. 12.5% per quarter for 8 quarters.
* Team: lock up 6 months, and then 2-years linear quarterly release. 12.5% per quarter for 8 quarters.
* Treasure: flexible to meet the need of pricing and liquidity

Below is the indicative maximized supply of UXLINK since listing in 16 quarters, 4 years.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

notes:

* Assuming the treasure (5%) is released when listing, the circulation supply would be around 10% of max supply; if not, the circulation supply would be around 5% of max supply.
* By end of 12th quarter, if the project reaches 30,000,000 users, the total supply would reach the max.

#### 5.2.3 The total supply of $UXLINK to community

The total supply of $UXLINK to community is directly related to the POW/POL of users and various builders, and thus shows positive correlation with the total numbers of users. According to our utility tokens generation formular: the maximized potential supply will occur when the total qualified users achieve 30,000,000; the networks' utility and gravity can support growth without a reward system beyond 30,000,000 users.&#x20;

The $UXLINK Frelease according to the total number of users; time axis is an indirect factor, indicating that:

* If total number of users reaches 30,000,000 earlier than scheduled, more $UXLINK will be release earlier.
* If the total number of users reaches 30,000,000 later than scheduled, the maximized supply will take longer time to released.
* If the total number of users cannot achieve 30,000,000 users, the total supply will not reach the max supply at all. As a result, the total supply would not reach the max-supply of 1,000,000,000.

### Summary:

UXLINK is social system includes social protocol and a series of Dapps for trading. As more users join and actively participate, UXLINK will evolve into a network consist of social graph, relationships, and socialized trading tools. More importantly, UXLINK create a revolutionary landing scenes, the web3 groups, to lead mass adoption.

Two characters distinguish UXLINK from other social protocols and Dapps:

* UXLINK combines real-world, acquaintances’ social connections with blockchain technology to enhance to trust of the web world.
* Encrypting and standardizing real-world groups into web3 operational units and making groups the landing scenes for web3 applications.

We cannot emphasize enough that UXLINK is truly community owned and community driven. The community is supported by renowned investors, has many talents builders, and expands into several markets. The future will undoubtedly be shaped by our powerful UXLINK community.
