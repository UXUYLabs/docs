# ðŸ“  FAQ

## Were UXUY tokens initially minted?

No, UXUY tokens were not initially minted. UXUY tokens are generated through the fair Proof of Link (POL) mechanism, and users can only obtain them by inviting friends and building social relationships.



## Will UXUY tokens be infinitely minted?

No, UXUY tokens will not be infinitely minted. The speed of UXUY token generation will decrease exponentially as the number of people in the UXLINK network increases over time. When the number of people in the UXLINK network reaches 30 million (the number of Bitcoin holding addresses), token generation will stop completely. The data model estimates that there will be a total of about 4 billion UXUY tokens. Additionally, UXUY tokens have a burning mechanism, so UXLINK will enter a deflationary state in the future.



## Why are UXUY tokens valuable?

UXUY tokens are a reward for monetizing social relationships. The number of UXUY tokens obtained by inviting friends to join the network reflects the social value of the user. Additionally, UXUY tokens are the application tokens of the ecosystem and can be used to purchase services or used in ecosystem DAPPs.



## How can I earn more UXUY tokens?

There are two ways to earn UXUY tokens: 1. Invite more friends to join your social network and earn token rewards for free; 2. Purchase UXUY tokens in a DEX or CEX.



## What can I do in the UXLINK ecosystem?

You can invite your friends to join the UXUY network and earn UXUY tokens for free. You can also purchase UXUY tokens in a DEX or exchange them for other tokens you like. Additionally, if you are a developer, you can join Builder and become a member of the UXLINK team.
