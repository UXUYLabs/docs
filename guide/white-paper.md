### Introduction:



The users of today's centralized social media apps do not truly own the data and value (social relationships, social data, etc.) that they create. When centralized apps change rules, algorithms, or stop their services, users will lose all their social relationships and data, and the commercial value of social data used by the app is unrelated to users. The UXUY protocol will solve this problem, helping users to own their social data through blockchain technology, and make it an asset.

UXUY is committed to becoming the infrastructure of the next generation of large-scale Web3 social applications, UXUY is a decentralized social graph protocol with network effects. The UXUY protocol uses "UXUY Token" to record users' contributions to the network constructed by the UXUY protocol. UXUY Token adopts the POL (Proof of Link) mechanism, and users can obtain token rewards by building social networks on UXUY, and they can also use tokens to purchase services or applications in other scenarios.



### Features of the UXUY protocol:
