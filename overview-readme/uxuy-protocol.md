## About UXUY Protocol

UXUY Protocol is committed to becoming the infrastructure for the next generation of large-scale Web3 social applications. UXUY Protocol is a decentralized social graph protocol with network effects.

UXUY Protocol uses "UXUY Token" to record user contributions to the network built on the UXUY protocol. UXUY Token is based on the Proof of Link (POL) mechanism, and users can earn token rewards by participating in the construction of social networks on UXUY. They can also use tokens to purchase services or applications in other scenarios.
