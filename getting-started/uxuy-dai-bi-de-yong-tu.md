# UXUY代币的用途?

UXUY代币是第一个可以将社交关系转化为资产的代币。代币应该是与这个人的社会影响力密切相关。 综上所述，代币还有很多令人激动的方向和机会，我们希望在不久的将来将他们整合在一起，例如：

&#x20;获取生态治理币&#x20;

根据用户拥有的UXUY代币,依据生态治理规则和分配方式给予治理币的奖励.&#x20;

获取生态应用代币&#x20;

优先获取优质生态应用的代币的认购、空投,参与早期生态应用活动获得更多代币及利益.&#x20;

优质社群&#x20;

通过UXUY平台，可以限定只有拥有一定数量其代币的用户进入各消息社群,优质高效获取web3最新动态并把握机会.&#x20;

优质内容&#x20;

拥有一定数量代币的用户可以访问特殊内容，又或者人们需每月以代币支付订阅费用才可以获得某些优质内容。&#x20;

新兴现象&#x20;

在面对新形社交生态环境,有趣之处在于这种机制,并不是在产品中有意设计的，在代币机制和社交规则下产生的新兴现象，那么想想就激动，我们究竟还有多少还没有想到的创新动力？

UXUY token is the first token that can convert social relationships into assets. The token should be closely related to the individual's social influence.

In summary, there are many exciting directions and opportunities for tokens, we hope to integrate them together in the near future, such as:

Obtaining Ecosystem Governance Tokens&#x20;

According to the UXUY tokens owned by users, rewards in governance tokens are given according to ecosystem governance rules and distribution methods.

Obtaining Ecosystem Application Tokens&#x20;

Users can have priority access to subscribe and receive airdrops of high-quality ecosystem application tokens, and participate in early ecosystem application activities to obtain more tokens and benefits.

High-quality Communities&#x20;

Through the UXUY platform, only users with a certain number of its tokens can enter various message communities to efficiently obtain the latest information of web3 and grasp opportunities.

High-quality Content&#x20;

Users with a certain number of tokens can access special content, or people may need to pay a monthly subscription fee in tokens to obtain certain high-quality content.

Emerging Phenomenon&#x20;

Faced with the new social ecological environment, the interesting aspect of this mechanism is that it is not intentionally designed within the product. Under the token mechanism and social rules, emerging phenomena have emerged. Thinking about it, how much innovative motivation do we still have that we haven't thought of?
