# ðŸ“š What 's the UXUY?



UXUY is an open and trusted social graph protocol. Networks built with this protocol can obtain truly belonging social relationship chains and assets, forming personal blockchain address books.&#x20;

Using new technologies such as intelligent MPC wallets, ZK proof, abstract accounts, and multi-chains, it protects user asset security and personal information privacy.&#x20;

Developers can quickly build projects using the SDK and achieve more efficient growth by reaching the blockchain address book.&#x20;

UXUY is a fully open-source project with only tokens and code, and its operation and development are entirely driven by the UXUY community.
